# Play Bittle Suite!

### About
I used to play wordle a bit - not as much as some of my peers. I thought wordle was a wonderful idea. So I decided to code my own version. Bittle: guess the bit. Bittle was simple and placed the joke elegantly, a short punchline exactly how I wanted to see it. The obvious next step? Modifications to bittle so users could guess the nibble (a fun term I picked up one day surfing the web: 4 bits) or the byte.

A few of my friends mentioned they liked it: that bitle was silly and a great joke. But the issue with Bittle was that, while it delivered my joke, there was no motivation to keep playing the game; no challenge. On wordle, the inspiration and the drive that people have for completing a phrase seemed so intrinsic at that moment: The trickier the word, the more intriguing the puzzle was. So I ++'ed the difficulty. Crumble++, Nibble++, and Bytle++ have special instructions to fool the player unpredictably. So, guessing the unpredictable sequence of bits, with some lies and some truths - that version of the game caught on. Before I knew it, people were playing every day.

Enjoy the suite of bit-guessing! :)
