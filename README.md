# Play Bittle Suite!

### About
I used to play wordle a bit - not as much as some of my peers. I thought wordle was a wonderful idea. So I decided to code my own version. Bittle: guess the bit. It made sense to code modifications so users could guess the nibble (a fun term I picked up one day surfing the web) or the byte.

A few of my friends (and friends' friends) mentioned they liked it: that it was silly and a great joke. But there was no motivation to keep playing the game. On wordle, the inspiration and the drive that people have for completing a phrase seemed so intrinsic at that moment, and the trickier the word, the more intriguing the puzzle was. So I ++'ed the difficulty. Crumble++, Nibble++, and Bytle++ have special instructions to fool the player unpredictably. So guessing the unpredictable sequence of bits, with some lies and some truths - that caught on. Before I knew it, some people were playing every day.

Enjoy the suite of bit-guessing! :)
